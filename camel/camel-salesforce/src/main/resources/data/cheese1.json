"Description__c": "Asiago is made in the region of Vicenza and Trento. It is a traditional, farmhouse and creamery, unpasteurized hard cheese. Originally made of ewes milk, now is made entirely of cows milk. There are two types of Asiago: first one (mistakenly taken for Pressato) is a lightly pressed cheese made from whole milk matured for 20-30 days. Another one (Asiago dAllevo) is the mature cheese made from skimmed milk. Long and slow maturation process creates fruity, slightly sharp cheese with a compact, granular interior full of small holes. Matured over 2 years, becomes intensely flavored. Can be grated and used as a condiment."
