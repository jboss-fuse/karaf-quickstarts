[[JDBC]]
= JDBC

Before going into technical details of Datasource configuration in OSGi runtime (like {f7}), let's review the common
mechanisms of Database connectivity in Javaâ„¢ platform.

== Connections

The most important _object_ used to perform data manipulation is an implementation of `java.sql.Connection` interface.
We don't have to remind how to use this object, but from the perspective of {f7} configuration, it's important to
learn how to _obtain_ it.

The libraries that contain the objects I'm going to describe are:

* PostgreSQL: `mvn:org.postgresql/postgresql/42.2.2`
* MariaDB: `mvn:org.mariadb.jdbc/mariadb-java-client/2.2.3`
* MySQL: `mvn:mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.46`
* Derby: `mvn:org.apache.derby/derbyclient/10.14.1.0` and `mvn:org.apache.derby/derby/10.14.1.0` (for embedded driver)

If we check existing implementation (contained in _driver JARs_) we can find:

* PostgreSQL: `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection`
* MariaDB: `org.mariadb.jdbc.MariaDbConnection`
* MySQL: `com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4Connection` (see also different `connect*()` methods of `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver`)
* Derby (networked): `org.apache.derby.client.net.NetConnection` (for `jdbc:derby:net:*` or `jdbc:derby://`)
* Derby (embedded): `org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedConnection` (for `jdbc:derby:*` or `jdbc:default:connection`)

These implementations contain database-specific logic to perform DML, DDL and simple transaction management.

In theory it's possible to manually create these connection objects, but there are two different JDBC methods that
hide the details and give cleaner API:

* `java.sql.Driver.connect()` - the method used in standalone applications long time ago
* `javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection()` - the preferred method using _factory_ pattern (note that similar method is
 used to obtain JMS connections from JMS connection factory. More about this later.)

We won't cover _driver manager_ approach here. It's enough to state that this method is just tiny _layer_ above
plain constructor of given connection object.

Using _data sources_ is quite complex topic and we'll talk about this later in this chapter.

=== Other connection interfaces

In addition to `java.sql.Connection` (which effectively implements database-specific communication protocol),
there are two other specialized _connection_ interfaces:

* `javax.sql.PooledConnection` which _represents_ physical connection while users's code doesn't interact with this
pooled connection directly. Instead the connection obtained using `getConnection()` method is used. This indirection
enables management of connection pool at the level of application server. The connection obtained using `getConnection()`
is usually a proxy. When such proxy connection is closed, physical connection is not closed and instead it becomes
available again in the managed connection pool.

* `javax.sql.XAConnection` allows obtaining `javax.transaction.xa.XAResource` associated with XA-aware connection
for use with `javax.transaction.TransactionManager`. Because `javax.sql.XAConnection` extends `javax.sql.PooledConnection,
it also provides method `getConnection()` giving access to JDBC connection object with typical DML/DQL methods.

== JDBC Data sources

JDBC 1.4 standard introduced `javax.sql.DataSource` interface that acted as _factory_ for `java.sql.Connection`
objects. Usually such data sources where bound to JNDI registry and located inside or injected into Java EE
components like servlets or EJBs. The key aspect was that these datasources were configured inside _application server_
and referenced in deployed applications by name.

Two remaining _connection_ objects have their own _data sources_:

|===
|data source |connection

|`javax.sql.DataSource`
|`java.sql.Connection`

|`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`
|`javax.sql.PooledConnection`

|`javax.sql.XADataSource`
|`javax.sql.XAConnection`
|===

It's worth emphasizing the most important differences between each of the above _data sources_:

* `javax.sql.DataSource` is most importantly a _factory_-like object to obtain `java.sql.Connection` instances.
The fact that most `javax.sql.DataSource` implementations usually perform _connection pooling_ should not
change the picture. This is the only interface that should be used by application code - whether it's direct JDBC
access, JPA persistence unit configuration (either `<jta-data-source>` or `<non-jta-data-source>`) or most of
the popular libraries (Apache Camel, Spring Framework, ...)
* `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` is most importantly a _bridge_ between generic (non database-specific)
connection pool/data source and database-specific data source. It may be treated as SPI interface. Application
code usually deals with generic `javax.sql.DataSource` obtained from JNDI bound and implemented by application
server (probably using a library like commons-dbcp2). On the other end, application code doesn't deal with
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` directly - it's used between application server and database-specific driver.
This can be shown using this simple sequence diagram:
+
[plantuml]
....
Application -> "App Server": javax.sql.DataSource.getConnection()
"App Server" -[#0000FF]> "Database Driver": javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource.getPooledConnection()
"Database Driver" -> "App Server": javax.sql.PooledConnection
"App Server" -> Application: javax.sql.PooledConnection.getConnection()
....

* `javax.sql.XADataSource` is a way to obtain `javax.sql.XAConnection` and `javax.transaction.xa.XAResource`. Same as
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`, it's used between application server and database-specific driver. Here's
slightly modified diagram with different actors, this time including JTA Transaction Manager:
+
[plantuml]
....
Application -> "App Server": UserTransaction.begin()
"App Server" -> "Transaction Manager": TransactionManager.getTransaction()
create Transaction
"Transaction Manager" -> Transaction: new
"App Server" <- Transaction: javax.transaction.Transaction

Application -> "App Server": DataSource.getConnection()
"App Server" -[#0000FF]> "Database Driver": javax.sql.XADataSource.getXAConnection()
create XAConnection
"Database Driver" -> XAConnection: new
XAConnection -> "App Server": javax.sql.XAConnection

"App Server" -> XAConnection: javax.sql.XAConnection.getXAResource()
XAConnection -> "App Server": javax.transaction.xa.XAResource
"App Server" -> Transaction: Transaction.enlistResource(XAResource)

"App Server" -> Application: XAConnection.getConnection()
....

As shown in two above diagrams, user interacts with _App Server_, which is generalized entity where we can configure
`javax.sql.DataSource` and `javax.transaction.UserTransaction` instances. Such instances may be
accessed either via JNDI or be injected using CDI or other DI mechanism.

[[application-only-needs-datasource]]
IMPORTANT: The important thing is that even if we (the application) use XA transactions and/or connection pooling, we
(the application) interact with `javax.sql.DataSource` and not the two other JDBC data source interfaces.

[[two-kinds-of-data-sources]]
=== Database specific and generic data sources

After the above introduction, we can separate JDBC data source implementations (of the three interfaces) into two
categories:

* generic `javax.sql.DataSource` implementations (like
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/[Apache Commons DBCP(2)], Apache Tomcat JDBC (based on DBCP),
http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/[C3P0], https://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP[Hikari CP], ...)
* database specific implementations of `javax.sql.DataSource`, `javax.sql.XADataSource` and
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`

What probably creates some confusion is the fact that _generic_ `javax.sql.DataSource` implementation can't
create database-specific connections on its own. And even if such _generic_ data source may use `java.sql.Driver.connect()`
or `java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection()`, it's usually better/cleaner to configure this _generic_
data source with ... database-specific `javax.sql.DataSource` implementation.

When _generic_ data source is going to interact with JTA, it *has to* be configured with database-specific implementation
of `javax.sql.XADataSource`.

To close the picture, _generic_ data source usually *doesn't* need database-specific implementation of
`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` in order to perform connection pooling - existing pools usually handle pooling
without standard JDBC interfaces (`javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` and `javax.sql.PooledConnection`) but using
own, custom implementation.

[[commons-dbcp2-standalone]]
=== Some generic data sources

Let's have a look at sample, well-known, generic data source,
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/[Apache Commons DBCP(2)].

.javax.sql.XADataSource implementations

DBCP2 doesn't include any implementation of `javax.sql.XADataSource` which is expected.

.javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource implementations

DBCP2 *does* include an implementation of `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`:
`org.apache.commons.dbcp2.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS`. It creates `javax.sql.PooledConnection`
objects using `java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection()` call. This pool should not be used directly and it should
be treated as an _adapter_ for drivers that:

* do not provide their own `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` implementation, and
* we want to use according to JDBC _recommendation_ for connection pools

As mentioned in the sequence diagram above, the driver provides `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` directly or with
the help of `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS` _adapter_, while DBCP2 implements the
_application server_ contract with one of:

* `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.PerUserPoolDataSource`
* `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.datasources.SharedPoolDataSource`

Both these pools take an instance of `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` at configuration stage.

But let's check the most important and interesting part of DBCP2:

.javax.sql.DataSource implementations

As mentioned previously - in order to implement connection pooling feature, we don't have to follow JDBC _recommendations_
to use `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` â†’ `javax.sql.PooledConnection` SPI.

Here is a list of _normal_ data sources of DBCP2:

* `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.BasicDataSource`
* `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.managed.BasicManagedDataSource`
* `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.PoolingDataSource`
* `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.managed.ManagedDataSource`

There are two _axes_ here:

._basic_ vs _pooling_

This _axis_ determines the _pooling configuration_ aspect.

Again, it's a bit confusing - both kinds of data sources perform _pooling_ of `java.sql.Connection` objects.
The *only* difference is that:

* _basic_ data source is configured using bean properties like `maxTotal` or `minIdle` used to configure internal
instance of `org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericObjectPool`.
* _pooling_ data source is configured with externally created/configured `org.apache.commons.pool2.ObjectPool`.

._managed_ vs _non-managed_

This _axis_ determines the _connection creation_ aspect and JTA behavior.

_non-managed basic_ data source creates `java.sql.Connection` instances using `java.sql.Driver.connect()` internally.

_non-managed pooling_ data source creates `java.sql.Connection` instances using the passed `org.apache.commons.pool2.ObjectPool`.

_managed pooling_ data source wraps `java.sql.Connection` instances inside `org.apache.commons.dbcp2.managed.ManagedConnection`
objects that ensure `javax.transaction.Transaction.enlistResource()` call if needed in JTA context. But still the
actual connection that is wrapped is obtained from any `org.apache.commons.pool2.ObjectPool` the pool is configured with.

And finally, _managed basic_ data source frees user from configuring dedicated `org.apache.commons.pool2.ObjectPool`. Instead
it's enough to configure existing, real, database-specific `javax.sql.XADataSource`. Bean properties will be used to
create internal instance of `org.apache.commons.pool2.impl.GenericObjectPool` which is then passed to ... internal
instance of _managed pooling_ data source (`org.apache.commons.dbcp2.managed.ManagedDataSource`).

NOTE: The only thing that DBCP2 can't do is _XA transaction recovery_. DBCP2 correctly enlists XAResources in active
JTA transactions, but it's not performing the recovery. This should be done separately and the configuration is usually
specific to chosen Transaction Manager implementation (like http://narayana.io/[Narayana]).

== Wrapping up

The recommended pattern is:

* create/obtain *database-specific* `javax.sql.DataSource` or `javax.sql.XADataSource` instance with database-specific
configuration (URL, credentials, ...) that knows how to create connections/XA connections,
* create/obtain *non database-specific* `javax.sql.DataSource` instance (internally configured with
the above, database-specific data source) with non database-specific configuration (connection pooling,
transaction manager, ...),
* use `javax.sql.DataSource` to get `java.sql.Connection` and perform JDBC operations.

[[canonical-datasource-example, Canonical DataSource example]]
Here's a _canonical_ example:

[source, java, options="nowrap"]
....
// database-specific, non-pooling, non-enlisting javax.sql.XADataSource
PGXADataSource postgresql = new org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource();
// database-specific configuration
postgresql.setUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/reportdb");
postgresql.setUser("fuse");
postgresql.setPassword("fuse");
postgresql.setCurrentSchema("report");
postgresql.setConnectTimeout(5);
// ...

// non database-specific, pooling, enlisting javax.sql.DataSource
BasicManagedDataSource pool = new org.apache.commons.dbcp2.managed.BasicManagedDataSource();
// delegate to database-specific XADatasource
pool.setXaDataSourceInstance(postgresql);
// delegate to JTA transaction manager
pool.setTransactionManager(transactionManager);
// non database-specific configuration
pool.setMinIdle(3);
pool.setMaxTotal(10);
pool.setValidationQuery("select schema_name, schema_owner from information_schema.schemata");
// ...

// JDBC code:
javax.sql.DataSource applicationDataSource = pool;

try (Connection c = applicationDataSource.getConnection()) {
    try (Statement st = c.createStatement()) {
        try (ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select ...")) {
            // ....
....

As we'll see later, in {f7} environment we have many configuration options and we're not even forced to use DBCP2.
